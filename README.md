PSX MINI THEME

Theme designed by frgn (free.gen)
Version 1.2
12/06/2017

=================================

A rethought look at the style of nes mini. I'm a big fan of the playstation, and after the nes-mini release I imagined what the psx-mini looked like.

The result is something similar to the nes-mini, but close to the design of the playstation and its graphical capabilities.
Designed for use at 16:9 aspect ratio only.
